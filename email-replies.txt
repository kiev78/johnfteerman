Thank you for reaching out to my office about the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act. I appreciate hearing from you.

As your senator, I am committed to protecting the right to vote, which belongs to every American citizen. It’s illegal for non-citizens to vote in Pennsylvania, where our state’s constitution extends voting rights only to U.S. citizens and federal law explicitly prohibits non-citizens from voting in federal elections.

The right to vote is the foundation of our American democracy, and it’s essential that every eligible voter, in Pennsylvania or anywhere else, is able to vote for the candidate of their choice. The best way to make sure elected officials are listening to the people is to protect the people’s right to vote them out.

We have real work to do to secure our elections and protect voting rights across the country, from passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act to providing our local governments with the resources they need for things like ballot security and election administration. I reject political stunts intended to spread lies, fear, and hate against our immigrant communities, and I do not support proposals, like the SAVE Act, that only make it harder for eligible voters to register and hold politicians accountable at the ballot box.

Thank you again for contacting me to share your thoughts. Please do not hesitate to reach out in the future about other issues of importance to you. If I can be of assistance, or if you’d like to learn more about my work on behalf of Pennsylvanians and our commonwealth, I encourage you to visit my website, https://www.fetterman.senate.gov/.
