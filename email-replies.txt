Thank you for reaching out to my office to share your support for legislation to address privatization of the United States Postal Service (USPS). I appreciate hearing from you. 
 
The core mission of USPS, which is written directly in our constitution, is to provide reliable, affordable, and universal mail service. This means service to all Americans, no matter where they live. Because of its commitment to universal service, USPS delivers mail in our major cities and to our most rural farms, carrying everything from postcards to life-saving medications. I firmly believe that no one should be cut off from the mail system because of where they call home. Privatization would mean just that, devastating our hardest to serve communities. 
 
As your senator, I will fight to make sure USPS continues operating as a part of the federal government. I am advocating not only for Americans who use the postal service, but also for the union members who do the hard work delivering mail to every corner of the country, rain or shine, heat wave or blizzard. I will always support efforts to keep USPS affordable and accessible for the Americans that depend on it. 
 
Thank you again for contacting me to share your thoughts. Please do not hesitate to reach out in the future about other issues of importance to you. If I can be of assistance, or if youâ€™d like to learn more about my work on behalf of Pennsylvanians and our commonwealth, I encourage you to visit my website, https://www.fetterman.senate.gov/.
