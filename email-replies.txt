Thank you for reaching out to my office. I appreciate hearing from you.

Republicans are trying to make it harder for Americans to access SNAP benefits in this year’s Farm Bill. As a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, you can be assured that I am fighting to protect SNAP as a critical safety net for all Americans.

SNAP is one of the most effective programs to fight hunger and poverty in this country and is a worthy investment. In my time as mayor of Braddock, as Lieutenant Governor, and now as a U.S. Senator, I’ve heard from Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth about their support for SNAP. From these conversations, I know that we need a Farm Bill that works for small farmers, rural communities, and hungry Americans. We also need to continue efforts to modernize SNAP.

It’s simple: Hunger is not a Republican or Democrat issue. Congress needs to stop playing political games with Americans’ access to food. I will continue to work with my colleagues and the USDA to include SNAP provisions in the Farm Bill that work for recipients in the 21st century and will serve all Americans.

That’s why I support the Closing the Meal Gap Act, which would strengthen SNAP by raising the baseline benefit for recipients, eliminate unrealistic barriers, and expand eligibility for American citizens in Puerto Rico. I am also a proud supporter of the EATS Act which would permanently expand SNAP eligibility for millions of food insecure college students. Please know that I’m committed to protecting and expanding SNAP for hard-working Americans who depend upon it. 

Thank you again for contacting me to share your thoughts.
