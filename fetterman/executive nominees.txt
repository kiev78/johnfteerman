Thank you for reaching out to my office about President-elect Trump’s Cabinet and senior executive nominees. I appreciate hearing from you.

One of the most important responsibilities I have as your senator is to consider and vote on the president’s nominations of federal judges, ambassadors, and other senior government officials, including Cabinet secretaries. I know that the decisions made by these nominees, if they’re confirmed, will affect the lives of Pennsylvanians in every corner of our commonwealth, which is why it’s so important that anyone who holds these roles is qualified and worthy of the public’s trust.

No matter who our president is, I’m going to hold every nominee to the same standard: they need the experience to be able to do the job and the character to act with the best interests of all Americans in mind. It's obvious that many of President Trump’s nominees fall short of these standards. Some of these picks, like his first choice for Attorney General, are straight up meant to troll Democrats – they’re not serious people, and they shouldn’t hold serious positions in our government.

I’ll inevitably have political differences with most of the president’s nominees, and there are some who I’ll never be able to vote for. That’s what happens when the other side wins elections. But I want to be clear: there have been capable individuals nominated to some of these posts, and I believe they should be given fair consideration by my Senate colleagues. I voted to confirm Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State and plan to do the same for Representative Elise Stefanik as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations because they are qualified and because I know they’ll stand up for our allies around the world, like Israel.

It’s also important to remember that Senate Republicans hold a 53-seat majority. They’re going to have the votes they need to confirm most of their nominees, and there’s no amount of panic or pearl-clutching from Democrats that’s going to change that math. At the end of the day, when it comes to those nominees who are flat out unfit to lead, whether or not they’re confirmed will come down to how many of my Republicans colleagues have the courage to vote against them.

Thank you again for contacting me to share your thoughts. Please do not hesitate to reach out in the future about other issues of importance to you. If I can be of assistance, or if you’d like to learn more about my work on behalf of Pennsylvanians and our commonwealth, I encourage you to visit my website, https://www.fetterman.senate.gov/.
