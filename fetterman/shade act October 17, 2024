Dear Senator John K. Fetterman,

As a constituent and outdoor enthusiast, I urge you to support the bipartisan SHADE Act to establish better tree canopy in formerly redlined neighborhoods that bear the brunt of climate change—including higher temperatures, higher energy costs and higher rates of asthma.

Trees are critical infrastructure that improve air quality, combat heat islands, buffer flooding and other extreme weather conditions and create healthier communities. They also increase property values, lower energy costs associated with cooling and heating and reduce the associated carbon emissions from avoided energy consumption. But studies have shown that formerly redlined neighborhoods are much hotter than non-redlined neighborhoods and have lower tree coverage.

The SHADE (Saving Hazardous And Declining Environments) Act would create a grant program under the Department of Housing and Urban Development to plant more trees in formerly redlined districts where they’re needed most. It would also include community involvement and give priority to areas that show efforts to reduce resident displacement. This bill is a critical step in ensuring the federal government is addressing extreme heat in vulnerable communities.

I urge you to support the SHADE Act and help move it through Congress as soon as possible.
