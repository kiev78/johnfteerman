Thank you for contacting me regarding President Trump’s Cabinet nominees. Your feedback is important to me as we work together to shape policies that benefit Pennsylvania and our country. 
 
As I have said, President Trump has nominated a team of disrupters to deliver on his promise of change, and historically Presidents of both parties have tended to get their preferred teams in place. At the same time, as a United States Senator, I take seriously my constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent on the President’s nominees.  
 
I have had one-on-one meetings with most of the President’s Cabinet nominees to discuss their qualifications and to raise issues important to Pennsylvanians. I have also questioned the nominees who have appeared before the committees on which I serve and reviewed the hearings of others. 
 
President Trump deserves to have a strong team in place to make America safer and more prosperous. Please know that I will keep your views in mind as the Senate works through the confirmation process for each of these nominees.  Following these confirmations, I will continue to engage with members of the Cabinet on what is best for Pennsylvania. 
 
It is an honor and a privilege to serve our great Commonwealth in the United States Senate. I appreciate having the benefit of your comments on this important matter. I am always grateful to hear from my constituents.
