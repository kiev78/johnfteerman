Thank you for contacting me and sharing your thoughts on issues important to you. Your feedback is important to me as we work together to shape policies that benefit Pennsylvania and our country. 

As the 54th U.S. Senator elected from Pennsylvania, I am honored to represent more than 13 million of our fellow citizens. I am committed to working with my Senate colleagues to reduce the cost of living, secure the border, unleash our nationâ€™s energy resources, restore American strength on the global stage, and protect the American Dream for future generations. To do my job, I rely on input from constituents. 

Since I was sworn in just over three months ago, I have worked diligently to respond to all the letters and calls from my constituents. To date, I have sent over 200,000 responses.

In addition, I host regular telephone town halls, where constituents can hear directly from me and ask questions. My next tele-town halls are scheduled for April 29 and May 14 at 7:00 PM. You can click here to reserve your spot and receive dial-in information.

Whenever the Senate is not in session, I prioritize being in Pennsylvania to meet with community leaders, tour small businesses, and engage with constituents. My team is also out in the field every day talking to Pennsylvanians.

To visit or connect with one of my six Pennsylvania-based offices or to stay updated on future town halls, please visit my website at www.mccormick.senate.gov. It is a privilege to serve our great Commonwealth in the United States Senate. I appreciate having the benefit of your comments.
