hank you for sharing your concerns regarding H.R. 1968, the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act of 2025 (P.L. 119-4). Your feedback is essential as we work together to shape policies that benefit Pennsylvania and our country.

Congress has a constitutional responsibility to fund the federal government. Under Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” Absent congressional action, funding for the federal government would have expired on March 14, 2025, resulting in a government shutdown. 

On March 11, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1968. This legislation funds the federal government through Fiscal Year 2025, which ends on September 30, 2025. On March 14, the U.S. Senate passed H.R. 1968, and President Trump signed the bill into law.

I believe there is no excuse for government shutdowns. When Congress fails to fund the government, it betrays its constitutional duty to the American people. That’s why I voted for H.R.1968 to fund the federal government and avert a shutdown. 

Now, we need to get back to regular order, pass appropriations bills, reduce wasteful spending, and get on a path where we do not have these unacceptable showdowns over keeping the government open.

In addition, the bill provided the largest pay raise for junior enlisted military personnel in over forty years. It also increased funding for the U.S. military to address growing overseas threats and included an additional $6 billion to treat veterans with service-related exposures to toxic substances. I will continue fighting for Pennsylvanians as Congress considers appropriations for Fiscal Year 2026. 

It is an honor and a privilege to serve our great Commonwealth in the United States Senate. I appreciate having the benefit of your comments on this important matter. I am always grateful to hear from my constituents.
