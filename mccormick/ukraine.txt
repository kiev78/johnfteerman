Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding the war in Ukraine and President Trump’s efforts to negotiate a lasting peace in the region. Your feedback is essential as we work together to shape policies that benefit Pennsylvania and our country. 

The United States has a core security interest in preserving a free and independent Ukraine. Despite the disastrous meeting in the Oval Office between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Trump, I believe the path to a durable peace and a deterred Russia remains open.

President Trump’s plan to end the bloodshed is still the most viable path forward. That path includes advancing a mineral rights agreement that gives our nation a vested interest in Ukraine’s economic future and preserving Ukraine as a free country backed by European security guarantees and U.S. intelligence, logistics, weapons, and economic investment.

However, this approach will only work if Europe carries more of the load. I believe in supporting our allies, but NATO members need to step up and meet their required defense spending targets instead of relying on the United States to make up the difference.

Pennsylvania is home to more than 150,000 Ukrainian Americans. I’ve heard many of their stories and share their desire to hold Putin accountable for his record of aggression against Ukraine. The parties need to come to the negotiating table. Ukraine and the United States need to sign the minerals agreement, and our European allies need to step up. This moment represents not just Ukraine’s best chance for a prosperous and secure future, but also the best path to deter Russian aggression and for a safer and more stable Europe.

It is an honor and a privilege to serve our great Commonwealth in the United States Senate. I appreciate having the benefit of your comments on this important matter. I am always grateful to hear from my constituents.
