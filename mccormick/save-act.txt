Thank you for contacting me regarding S.128, the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act. Your feedback is important to me as we work together to shape policies that benefit Pennsylvania and our country. 
 
The SAVE Act would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to require proof of United States citizenship when registering to vote. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, but this bill would clarify existing law and establish additional methods for confirming U.S. citizenship. It also directs states to remove noncitizens from lists of eligible voters. Additionally, the legislation establishes federal penalties for intentionally registering noncitizens to vote in a federal election. 

It is a core tenet of our democracy that elections be free and fair. Voting in elections is a privilege and responsibility that must only be afforded to our nationâ€™s own citizens. This legislation would strengthen laws that safeguard our elections from outside influence. 

It is an honor and a privilege to serve our great Commonwealth in the United States Senate. I appreciate having the benefit of your comments on this important matter, and I will keep your views in mind should Congress consider the SAVE Act. I am always grateful to hear from my constituents.
